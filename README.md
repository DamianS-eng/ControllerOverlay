# Controller Overlay
###### _Version 1.1_

## Purpose

This repository is hosting a set of modifications and custom skins made to work with the controller overlay from [gamepadviewer.com](http://gamepadviewer.com). Basically it loads the original overlay from the website, while injecting some custom css code and images to make it work a bit better for my purposes.

## Usage

Visit [adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay](https://adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay) for the overlay.
This link will give you the default version, but there is also a special skin for Broughy1322's Twitch streams, which is accessible at [adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay/Broughy](https://adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay/Broughy).

In case you want to use it in OBS, add the same URL as a browser source.
In the browser source setup window, it's recommended that you set the width and height in the browser source settings both to 800, the FPS to your recording / streaming frame rate, then once you confirm it, right click on the overlay in the preview window, and set the scale filtering to bilinear.
