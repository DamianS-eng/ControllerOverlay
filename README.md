# Controller Overlay
###### _Version 1.1_

## Purpose

This repository is hosting a set of modifications and custom skins made to work with the controller overlay from [gamepadviewer.com](http://gamepadviewer.com). Basically it loads the original overlay from the website, while injecting some custom css code and images to make it work a bit better for my purposes.

## Usage

Simply visit [adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay](https://adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay) to get the overlay itself.
This link will give you the default version of the overlay, but there is also a special skin made specifically for Broughy1322's Twitch streams, which is accessible at [adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay/Broughy](https://adam10603.github.io/ControllerOverlay/Broughy).

In case you want to use it inside OBS to appear on your streams / recordings, simply add the same URL as a browser source in OBS.
Within OBS, it's recommended that you set the width and height in the browser source settings both to 800, the FPS to your recording / streaming frame rate, then right click on the overlay in the preview window, and set the scale filtering to bilinear.
